Low-E ThermaSheet® may be installed directly under shingles, metal roofing, etc. and is ICC approved (ESR-3652) to be used as a stand alone alternative to felt paper and other traditional underlayments that do nothing to protect your home from heat gain/loss. Isn’t it time your roofing underlayment did more? Now it can, with Low-E ThermaSheet®. Do more, with less. Save energy. Save money. Period.
