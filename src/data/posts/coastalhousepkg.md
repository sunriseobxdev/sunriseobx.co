The unique coastal environment presents specific challenges for homeowners. Whether it’s the salty air, intense sun, or high winds, the coastal climate requires durable, energy-efficient materials. Sunrise Construction’s *Cool Coastal House Package* meets these demands with two standout products: Low-E House Wrap and SolarDefense Siding. These elements work in harmony to create homes that are resilient, energy-efficient, and visually striking.

### Low-E House Wrap: Optimized Energy Efficiency
One of the key products in the Cool Coastal House Package is Low-E House Wrap. This innovative material offers significant energy savings by reflecting up to 97% of radiant heat. By creating a thermal break and adding R-value to the wall system, it helps regulate indoor temperatures, reducing the need for excessive heating or cooling. This means more comfort year-round and lower energy bills.

The Low-E House Wrap not only enhances thermal performance but also stops thermal bridging through sidewall studs, preventing energy loss. It adds sound attenuation comparable to 3 inches of fiberglass, contributing to a quieter, more peaceful living space. Installation is seamless and straightforward, with full five-square coverage thanks to a built-in overlap. Compatible with most exterior cladding, this versatile product is trusted by builders and remodelers nationwide.

### SolarDefense Siding: Style Meets Durability
Sunrise Construction pairs energy efficiency with unbeatable style using SolarDefense siding. This cutting-edge siding technology is designed to protect homes from the harsh sun while offering gorgeous, bold colors that won’t fade. SolarDefense Reflective Technology effectively prevents heat absorption and distortion, ensuring that your home maintains its appearance even under the strongest coastal sun.

In addition to heat protection, SolarDefense siding resists UV damage with its tough, UV-stable polymer. This durable material is molecularly bonded to ensure long-lasting performance. Homeowners can enjoy the beauty of dark, rich siding without the worry of fading, peeling, or cracking. The easy maintenance—just soap and water—is another key advantage, offering a hassle-free solution to exterior care.

### Expert Installation: A Key Differentiator
What truly separates Sunrise Construction from other builders is their commitment to superior installation practices, designed specifically for the coastal environment. All siding is installed with stainless steel fasteners, which are corrosion-resistant and won’t deteriorate over time, ensuring the longevity of the exterior.

In addition, Sunrise Construction uses Huber Zip flashing tape to seal not only the laps in the Low-E House Wrap but also all siding accessories, including J-channels, light boxes, and corners. This added attention to detail provides an extra layer of protection, preventing moisture intrusion and ensuring a complete, durable installation.

### Coastal Resilience and Comfort
Sunrise Construction’s Cool Coastal House Package combines the power of Low-E House Wrap and SolarDefense siding to create a home that is not only energy-efficient but also resilient against the harsh elements of the coast. The package offers top-tier thermal insulation, energy savings, and lasting beauty—all essential for homeowners in coastal environments.

With a commitment to quality craftsmanship and durable materials, Sunrise Construction continues to deliver homes built to withstand the test of time, while providing modern comfort and style.
